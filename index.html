    <h1>Plushies ðŸ§¸ </h1>
    <p>I was thinking of making a create your own plushy kind of thing? You customize your plushy and make it special to you, something sentimental. It'll offer a lot of customization to allow for personalization and creative expression through clothes + accessories.</p>

    <h1>Drink Bar ðŸ§‹ </h1>
    <p>This will be a drink bar and I'm gonna utilize a lot of CSS to make it very animated hopefully but it will showcase creative drinks with some allergy-friendly treats too. All of the drinks will be accomodating to allergies (I have many many allergies) so everyone can enjoy no matter what. I won't outwardly disclose this fact and make it the main thing because I want everyone to enjoy it without having to worry but I will of course make sure that information is there.</p>
